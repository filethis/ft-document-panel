### \<ft-document-panel\>

This element displays a list of FileThis [document resources](https://filethis.com/developers/doc/index.html#/document). Above the list is a header area that can display a title and several buttons that affect how the document items are displayed, or operate on the selected documents. Which header elements are displayed is configurable.

Depending on configuration and what the user has selected using the header buttons, the document items will be displayed either as a grid or a list, using [ft-document-grid](https://github.com/filethis/ft-document-grid) or [ft-document-list](https://github.com/filethis/ft-document-list), respectively.
